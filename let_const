// Lecture: Let and Const

// ES5
var name5 = "Sukhveer";
var age5 = 29;
name5 = "Sukh Sangha";
console.log(name5 + ", " + age5);

// ES6
const name6 = "Sukhveer";
// let - something that can change
let age6 = 29;
// name6 = "Sukh Sangha"; Doesn't work because we used const
console.log(name6);

//Variables declared with let and const in ES6 are block scoped as opposed to function scoped in ES5

// ES5
function driversLicense(passedTest){
	if(passedTest){
		var firstName = "Sukh";
		var dob = 1990;
	}
	console.log(firstName + ", " + dob + ", is officially allowed to drive");//Should work, as it's still in the same function
}

driversLicense(true);

// ES6
function driversLicense(passedTest){
	// console.log(firstName); Can no longer do this, hoist it.
	let firstName;
	
	if(passedTest){
		firstName = "Sukh";
		const dob = 1990; // has to be declared inside the block unless you define it also on the outside
	}
	//console.log(firstName + ", " + dob + ", is officially allowed to drive"); //Doesn't work, has to be inside the block
}

driversLicense(true);

// You can also no longer call a variable before it is declared.
