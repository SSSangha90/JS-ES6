let firstName = "Sukhveer";
let lastName = "Sangha";
const DOB = 1990;
function calcAge(year){
	return 2019 - year;
}

//ES5
console.log("This is " + firstName + " " + lastName + ". He was born in " + DOB + ". Today he is " + calcAge(DOB) + " years old.");
//Quite a lot of concatenation work

//ES6
//Now you can use BACK TICKS for a TEMPLATE LITERALS
//Then you use the $sign, followed by curly braces and then pop the variable inside

console.log(`This is ${firstName} ${lastName}. He was born in ${DOB}. Today he is ${calcAge(DOB)} years old.`);

//Similar to Ruby

const fullName  = `${firstName} + ${lastName}`;
console.log(fullName.startsWith('S'));
//new method that determins if the string starts with a certain letter or not.

//we also have ends with
console.log(fullName.endsWith('s'));

//middle of the string, we have includes
console.log(fullName.includes('ang'));

//These three new methods are included in ES6

console.log(firstName.repeat(5));
//if we want a space in their, use the template literal
